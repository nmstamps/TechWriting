									<h1>Henderson Hall</h1>
									<p>Henderson Hall is a building located at the center of campus<br />
									and Blacksburg, but despite it's many resources, few know about the building.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_0452_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Henderson Hall is located past the Squires student center, towards Main Street. Its official address is <blockquote>195 Alumni Mall, Blacksburg, VA 24061.</blockquote></p>

								<p><br /><br /><br />Compared to other buildings on campus, Henderson Hall is undervalued and underrated despite its plethora of resources. The primary is for off campus students, it is located on the main drive through campus Alumni Mall, allowing for easy parking, either after hours or at a paid meter. Inside, there are many resources including:</p>
								<ul style="line-height: 110%;">
									<li>A costume shop</li>
									<li>A computer lab</li>
									<li>Study spaces</li>
									<li>Practice rooms</li>
									<li>Study spaces</li>
									<li>A Black Box theater</li>
									<li>An orchestra room</li>
									<li>An audio recording studio</li>
									<li>An AV editinig editing facility</li>
									<li>2 design lab classrooms
										<ul style="margin-bottom: -0px;">
											<li>One for Costume Design</li>
											<li>One for Scenic Design</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>A practice space for large groups working on dance numbers</li>
									<li>THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PHRASE THAT</li>
									<li>2 outdoor amphitheaters
										<ul>
											<li>Henderson Amphitheater with dedicated seating area for smaller audiences</li>
											<li>Henderson Lawn that's more abstract, but suited for larger audiences</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Henderson Hall offers many resources that students can use. Unlike most buildings on campus, Henderson Hall has specific hours. It is open from <strong>7am to 7:30 pm.</strong> Outside of these hours, it is possible to access Henderson Hall through swipe access; however, swipe access is only granted to Art and Music Majors.</p>
								<h2>Site Inspection</h2>
								<p>Several students researched the Henderson Hall and searched for all of the potential resources there. They discovered many. Henderson Hall has a plethora or different tools; most of the tools are tailored toward Music and Art students, however many of these tools can be accessed by any students. The 3rd floor contains pianos, including a suprisingly nice grand piano, and practice rooms that are open to everyone. There are quiet study spaces, and study spaces near the practice room if you enojoy background music. Many of the resources listed above are only for Art or Theater majors, or are on a class by class basis</p>
								<h2>User Survey</h2>
								<p>User surveys were sent out to students to gather information about the general knowledge students had of Henderson Hall. At the time of writing, a total of 61 survey responses were gathered. From the survey, an overwhelming majority of students had never been to the building and had no idea where the building was located. From the survey responses, it can be concluded that the average student has a lack of knowledge of Henderson Hall. This lack of information of Henderson Hall can be remedied by providing a more generalized medium of academic halls at Virginia Tech.</p>
								<h2>User Interviews</h2>
								<p>When users were interviewed about this location there were many different opinions about the space. Students who have a specific reason to be there tend to like the resorces that Henderson provides. Such as, students within the art and theatre major tend to like the musical instruments that are provided as well as the open space to proactice. Students who need to visit thier professor's office hours tend to like the space as it is near a bus stop, parking lot and Squires Student center. However, an overwhelming consensus of students is that the rooms are elimited in which to study, however that being said it is a very quiet place to practice if need be or hold a small review session. </p>
