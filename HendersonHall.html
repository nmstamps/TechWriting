									<h1>Henderson Hall</h1>
									<p>Henderson Hall is a building located at the edge of campus<br />
									and downtown Blacksburg, but despite it's many resources, few know about the building and all of its resources.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_0452_2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Henderson Hall is located past the Squires Student Center, towards Main Street. Its official address is <blockquote>195 Alumni Mall, Blacksburg, VA 24061.</blockquote></p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/map.png" style="width:500px;heigh:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:50%;" alt="" /></div>
								<p style="margin-top: -140px;"><br /><br /><br />Compared to other buildings on campus, Henderson Hall is undervalued despite its plethora of resources. The primary is for off campus students, it is located on the main drive through campus Alumni Mall, allowing for easy parking, either after hours or at a paid meter. Inside, there are many resources including:</p>
								<ul style="line-height: 190%;">
									<li>A costume shop</li>
									<li>A computer lab</li>
									<li>Study spaces</li>
									<li>Practice rooms for performing arts</li>
									<li>A Black Box theater</li>
									<li>An orchestra room</li>
									<li>An audio recording studio</li>
									<li>An AV editing facility</li>
									<li>Two design lab classrooms
										<ul style="margin-bottom: -0px;">
											<li>One for Costume Design</li>
											<li>One for Scenic Design</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>A practice space for large groups working on dance numbers</li>
									<li>Two outdoor amphitheaters
										<ul>
											<li>Henderson Amphitheater with a dedicated seating area for smaller audiences</li>
											<li>Henderson Lawn that's more abstract, but suited for larger audiences</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p style="margin-top: -10px;">Unlike most buildings on campus, Henderson Hall has specific hours. It is open from <strong>7am to 7:30 pm.</strong> Outside of these hours, it is possible to access Henderson Hall through swipe access; however, swipe access is only granted to Art and Music Majors.</p>
								<h2>Site Inspection</h2>
								<p>Several students performed site inspections of Henderson Hall and searched for all of the potential resources there. The site inspections were performed with a pre-estblished set of questions. The site inspections were designed to be as impartial as possible. The resuls revealed that Henderson Hall has a plethora of different tools to offer; most of the tools are tailored toward Music and Art students, however many of these tools can be accessed by any students. It is to be noted that some of the more theatre/art focused resources listed above are only for Art or Theater majors, or are available only upon a class by class basis. The resources are listed above.</p>
								<h2>User Survey</h2>
								<p>User surveys were sent out to students to gather information about the general knowledge students had of Henderson Hall. At the time of writing, a total of 61 survey responses were gathered. From the survey, an overwhelming majority of students had never been to the building and had no idea where the building was located. However, of those respondees who make use of Henderson Hall on a regular basis, the feedback gathered stated that the amenities that Henderson provides are very good. The technology was said to be very up to date which most likely alluded to the design and AV labs in the building. From the survey responses, it can be concluded that the average student has a lack of knowledge of Henderson Hall. This lack of information of Henderson Hall can be remedied by providing a more generalized medium of academic halls at Virginia Tech.</p>
								<h2>User Interviews</h2>
								<p>When users were interviewed about this location there were many different opinions about the space. Students who have a specific reason to be there tend to like the resorces that Henderson provides. Such as, students within the art and theatre major tend to like the musical instruments that are provided as well as the open space to practice. Students who need to visit thier professor's office hours tend to like the space as it is near a bus stop, parking lot and Squires Student center. However, an overwhelming consensus of students is that the rooms are limited in which they can study, however that being said it is a very quiet place to practice if need be or hold a small review session. </p>
