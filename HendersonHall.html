								<p>Henderson Hall is located past the Squires student center, towards Main Street. It's official address is "195 Alumni Mall, Blacksburg, VA 24061." Compared to other buildings on campus, Henderson Hall is undervalued and underrated despite its plethora of resources. The primary is for off campus students, it is located on the main drive through campus Alumni Mall, allowing for easy parking, either after hours or at a paid meter. Inside, there is a costume shop, a computer lab, study spaces, practice room, etc.. Henderson Hall offers many resources that students can use. Henderson Hall, unlike most buildings on campus has specific hours. It is open from 7am to 7:30 pm. Outside of these hours, it is possible to access Henderson Hall through swipe access; however, swipe access is only granted to Art and Music Majors.</p>
								<h2>Site Inspection</h2>
								<p>Several students researched the Henderson Hall and searched for all of the potential resources there. They discovered many. Henderson Hall has a plethora or different tools; most of the tools are tailored toward Music and Art students, however many of these tools can be accessed by any students. The 3rd floor contains pianos, including a suprisingly nice grand piano, and practice rooms that are open to everyone. </p>
